# Selenium Twitter Login and Search Script

This is an automated Python script that uses Selenium WebDriver to log into Twitter (X) and search for a specific hashtag. The script navigates the login page, enters credentials, and performs a search for a hashtag.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following:

1. **Python** installed (version 3.x).
2. **Selenium** library installed.
3. **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** (or any other supported browser driver).

### Install Selenium

To install Selenium, run the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium
```



Install WebDriver
You will need to download the Microsoft Edge WebDriver or the driver for the browser of your choice. Ensure that the version of the WebDriver matches the version of your browser.

Place the WebDriver executable in a directory that's included in your system's PATH, or specify the path in the script.

How to Use
Open the script in your Python environment.
Replace "Enter your username" and "enter your password" with your Twitter (X) credentials.
Modify the search term in searchSmth.send_keys("#search for a tag" + Keys.ENTER) to any hashtag or search term you want to search on Twitter (X).
Run the script.


The script will:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Navigate to the login page of Twitter (X).
Enter your username and password (ensure that the credentials are correct).
Wait for successful login and search for the specified hashtag.
Print the results of the search to the console.
Important Notes
Security: Avoid storing sensitive information like your username and password directly in the code for security reasons. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file to store them securely.
WebDriver Version Compatibility: Ensure your WebDriver version matches the browser version.
X Paths and Selectors: The XPaths used in this script are specific to the current layout of Twitter (X). If Twitter updates its layout or structure, the XPaths may break. In such cases, you would need to update the XPaths accordingly.
Troubleshooting
Element Not Found: If the script is unable to find an element, inspect the page using browser developer tools (F12) and adjust the XPaths as needed.
WebDriver Issues: Ensure that the correct version of the WebDriver is being used and it's correctly placed in the system PATH.
